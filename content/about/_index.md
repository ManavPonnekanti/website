## Projects

Projects I have done, both current and ongoing:

### Research

- Non-reference-based enhancement of degraded fundus images using neural networks with [Pontikos Lab](https://pontikoslab.com).
- Extraction and processing of keratometer values produced by the adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AO-SLO) under Dr Angelos Kalitzeos at [UCL Institute of Ophthalmology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioo/).

I'm seeking research experience, internships, or part-time employment in the above or related areas. My full CV is available [here](/assets/CV.pdf).

### Personal

- Creating programming bootcamps for healthcare workers and biomedical researchers with [Tim Rooney](https://twitter.com/tjrwriting).
- Building a backlinked wiki of all of my medical school [notes](/notes), accessible to all. An experiment in second brains and learning in public.
