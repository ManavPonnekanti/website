## Projects

Projects I have done, both current and ongoing:

### Research

- Non-reference-based enhancement of degraded fundus images using neural networks with [Pontikos Lab](https://pontikoslab.com).
- Extraction and processing of keratometer values produced by the adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AO-SLO) under Dr Angelos Kalitzeos at [UCL Institute of Ophthalmology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioo/).

I'm seeking research experience, internships, or part-time employment in the above or related areas. My full CV is available [here](/assets/CV.pdf).

### Personal

- Creating programming bootcamps for healthcare workers and biomedical researchers with [Tim Rooney](https://twitter.com/tjrwriting).
- Building a backlinked wiki of all of my medical school [notes](/notes), accessible to all. An experiment in second brains and learning in public.

## Colophon

This blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go. Previous versions used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). It is hosted for free on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). The source code is available [here](https://github.com/mnvpn/website), feel free to use or adapt as you see fit. Posts are written in the Markdown notes app [Bear](https://bear.app).

A goal of this site is to be as fast, legible, and widely supported as possible. This means semantic HTML, no JavaScript, no web fonts, and minimal CSS. It also uses an [instant.page](https://instant.page) script to improve load-times. Thank you for visiting!
