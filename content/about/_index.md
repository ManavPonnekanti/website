title: About
---

I'm Manav, a second year medical student at University College London. I am interested in the application of AI/ML to solve frontier problems in healthcare and neuroscience. Currently, my main academic interests are neuromodulation and brain-computer interfaces.

I'm also exploring philosophy of science, particularly in the context of the mind-body problem and the nature of consciousness. In my free time, I like reading Golden Age science fiction, playing jazz piano, and tinkering with open source software.

## Projects

Projects I have done, both current and ongoing:

### Research

- Non-reference-based enhancement of degraded fundus images using neural networks with [Pontikos Lab](https://pontikoslab.com).
- Extraction and processing of keratometer values produced by the adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AO-SLO) under Dr Angelos Kalitzeos at [UCL Institute of Ophthalmology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioo/).

I'm seeking research experience, internships, or part-time employment in the above or related areas. My full CV is available [here](/assets/CV.pdf).

### Personal

- Creating programming bootcamps for healthcare workers and biomedical researchers with [Tim Rooney](https://twitter.com/tjrwriting).
- Building a backlinked wiki of all of my medical school [notes](/notes), accessible to all. An experiment in second brains and learning in public.

## Colophon

This blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go. Previous versions used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). It is hosted for free on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). The source code is available [here](https://github.com/mnvpn/website), feel free to use or adapt as you see fit. Posts are written in the Markdown notes app [Bear](https://bear.app).

A goal of this site is to be as fast, legible, and widely supported as possible. This means semantic HTML, no JavaScript, and minimal CSS. It also uses an [instant.page](https://instant.page) script to improve load-times. Thank you for visiting!
