I'm Manav, a second year medical student at University College London. I am interested in the application of AI/ML to solve frontier problems in healthcare and neuroscience. Currently, my main academic interests are neuromodulation and brain-computer interfaces.

I'm also exploring philosophy of science, particularly in the context of the mind-body problem and the nature of consciousness. In my free time, I like reading Golden Age science fiction, playing jazz piano, and tinkering with open source software.
